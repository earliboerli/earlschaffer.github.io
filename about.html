      As I said, I'm a big potato guy. I like em roasted, mashed, hashed, scalloped, frittatated (yes that's a word in my world)
      and of course my personal favorite - fried... mhmmm can't beat french fries.

      Just like Arnold Schwarzenegger I hail from Austria. To steal Arnold's phrase - Born in Austria, Made in America.
      I'm also a big petrolhead - I like anything that smells like burned rubber, old leather or gasolina (if the song gasolina just popped into your head, then we should be friends)
      If you're also petrolhead you should check out my passion project - Rennpunkt.

      Professionally, I'm in payments at Visa. I make money move.
      I've combined my work in payments with my passion for cars and am currently building a car community
      for people in payments called FAST MONEY FAST CARS.

      I currently live in San Francisco with my wife and our dog.
